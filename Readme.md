## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

- **Forms**: 
  - `Create_form`: Handles the creation of new URLs and short codes.
  - `Fetch_form`: Used for retrieving the original URL based on the short code.
  - `Edit_form`: Allows editing the original URL associated with a short code.
  - `Delete_form`: Facilitates the deletion of a URL-short code pair.
  
- **Models**:
  The `url_schema` model defines the structure of the database table for storing URLs and their metadata:
  ```
  from django.db import models

  class url_schema(models.Model):
      id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
      url = models.URLField()
      shortCode = models.CharField(max_length=10)
      count = models.IntegerField(default=0)
      createdAt = models.CharField(max_length=100)
      updatedAt = models.CharField(max_length=100)

      def __hash__(self) -> int:
          return hash((self.id, self.url, self.shortCode, self.createdAt, self.updatedAt))
    ```

### Templates:
- **`index.html`**: 
  - Displays a form for creating a shortened URL.
  - Provides feedback on the generated short URL upon successful submission.

- **`fetch.html`**: 
  - Contains a form for entering a short code to retrieve the original URL.
  - Displays the original URL and access count if the short code exists.

- **`update.html`**: 
  - Provides a form for updating the original URL linked to a short code.
  - Displays a status message upon successful or unsuccessful update.

- **`delete.html`**: 
  - Features a form for entering a short code to delete its associated URL.
  - Displays a confirmation or error message based on the action's result.

### CSS Styling:
All templates use a shared styling approach:
- Comic Sans MS font for a playful design.
- Form inputs styled for clarity and consistency.
- Buttons styled for prominence with hover effects.
- Aesthetic labels and clean layouts for user-friendly interaction.

## üõ¢Ô∏è Database Schema

The application uses the following schema to manage URLs:

| Field        | Type         | Description                                   |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `id`         | AutoField    | Unique identifier for each record.           |
| `url`        | URLField     | The original long URL.                       |
| `shortCode`  | CharField    | A 6-character hash representing the short URL. |
| `count`      | IntegerField | Tracks the number of times the short URL is accessed. |
| `createdAt`  | CharField    | Timestamp when the record was created.       |
| `updatedAt`  | CharField    | Timestamp when the record was last updated.  |

## üö® Error Handling

- **Duplicate URLs**: If a URL already exists, its short code is retrieved instead of creating a duplicate entry.
- **Invalid Short Codes**: Fetch, update, or delete operations on nonexistent short codes return appropriate error messages.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures that input data meets requirements for URL format and field constraints.
